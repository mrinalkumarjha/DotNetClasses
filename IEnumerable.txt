IEnumerable<T> Interface :
    Exposes the enumerator, which supports a simple iteration over a collection of a specified type. 
    
    We are able to loop on list because under the hood for each use use Getenumerator method of IEnumerable. Thats why foreach works on all collection
    As all microsoft collection implement IEnumerable.
    
    Linq also use Ienumerable under the hood that is the reason linq can iterate through collection.
    
    ex: 
    var x= from y in mycollection
